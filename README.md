## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties/vars
- CSS grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I practiced using flex grow. On the "Why Us" section, due to the list, this section was taller by default than the "Monthly Subscription" one.

So for example just adding a margin-top to the "Sign Up" button wouldn't make it aligned at the bottom with the list on the "Why Us" section.
I placed a flex-grow: 1; on the text above the button which made the button go all the way to the button so it aligned good. Alignment is very important in design so I took it seriously.
